# Image_Classification
The Dataset should be downloaded from Kaggle (Cats vs Dogs). Contains 25000 Images. 
• Build a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Dogs and Cats from 10000 Kaggle Image Dataset. The network has 2 layers of convolution, max pooling, used ReLu activations, dropout regularization technique and the optimizer is done using Adam update.
• Implemented the algorithm in Python using TensorFlow, Keras and runs with accuracy of 85%.
• The input, epocs and hidden layers can be altered based on your GPU.
